# Explain
Explain in your own words the use of `arr.length` as an index for array `temporary` in line 83 of `Realistic.java` in this repository.

# Answer
'arr.length' is used to access the last index from the larger array 'temporary' because it points to the last element in the array, which would be the new element. It is safe to use that method because the array 'temporary' was declared arr.length + 1.
